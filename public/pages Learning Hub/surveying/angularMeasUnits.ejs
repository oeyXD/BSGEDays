    <h1>Units of Angular Measurement</h1>
    <p>
        In surveying, angles can be measured in several different units. The most common units of angular
        measurement are degrees, radians, and grads.
    </p>

    <h2>Degrees</h2>
    <p>
        Degrees are the most widely used unit for measuring angles in surveying. A full circle is divided into
        360 degrees (°). Each degree is further divided into 60 minutes (') and each minute into 60 seconds (").
    </p>

    <h2>Radians</h2>
    <p>
        Radians are another unit of angular measurement commonly used in mathematics and engineering. A full
        circle is equal to 2π radians. 1 radian is approximately equal to 57.2958 degrees. Radians are often used in
        calculations involving trigonometric functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Grads</h2>
    <p>
        Grads, also known as gons or grades, divide a full circle into 400 grads. This unit is less commonly used but
        can be found in some surveying applications, particularly in Europe.
    </p>

    <h2>Conversion Between Units</h2>
    <p>
        It is often necessary to convert between different units of angular measurement. Here are some common
        conversion formulas:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Degrees to Radians: radians = degrees × (π / 180)</li>
        <li>Radians to Degrees: degrees = radians × (180 / π)</li>
        <li>Degrees to Grads: grads = degrees × (10 / 9)</li>
        <li>Grads to Degrees: degrees = grads × (9 / 10)</li>
    </ul>
